can you implement hoist based on the .md files? ensure a robust implementation by constantly using verification ie checkers, compilers, test cases, etc. ensure correctness as you build out incrementally and modularly

ok what are the remaining todos before I can launch this on hackernews? anything else in the .md files that are not implemented?

any remaining items for adoption and release? I think we should build a local demo to show that it actually works in python/js? https://arxiv.org/html/2512.24601v1 was the original inspiration so if we can run some kind of local ollama model with this actually working, that would be awesome
